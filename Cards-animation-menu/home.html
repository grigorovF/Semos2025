          <h3>Blue Jay</h3>
          <p>
            This is a striking image of a Blue Jay, a bird known for its vibrant
            blue feathers, bold black markings, and intelligent behavior. Native
            to North America, Blue Jays are often found in forests, parks, and
            suburban areas, where their loud calls and curious nature make them
            easy to spot. They're not just beautiful â€” Blue Jays are also known
            for their cleverness, sometimes mimicking the calls of hawks to
            scare off other birds. Their presence adds color and personality to
            any natural setting.
